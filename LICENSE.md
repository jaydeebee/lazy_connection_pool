LazyConnectionPool License
==========================

LazyConnectionPool is provided as-is, with the hopes (but not the promise) 
that you find it useful.  No warranties are provided, express or implied.

The license may change in the future to be more restrictive, but as of
this commit, you can copy, include, fork, or redistribute the code, in
whole or in part, in source or (somehow) compiled, with the request that
source distributions mention the originating webpage and a description of
how much the code has changed since you got your hands on it.

For example:

	"This code was originally based on LazyConnectionPool, with
	some minor fixes"
	
or,

	"copied from LazyConnectionPool, and totally rewritten."

If you rewrite it so significantly as to be unrecognizable, this request
is waived.  Please use your best judgement as to what "unrecognizeable"
means.
